# Bank-Deposit-Predictor-Classifier

Project Description

Bank-Deposit-Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether clients of a Portuguese banking institution will subscribe to a term deposit based on their response to direct marketing campaigns conducted through phone calls. The project leverages data from these campaigns to build a predictive model that helps in identifying potential customers who are likely to subscribe.

Business Context

In the competitive banking industry, attracting and retaining customers for various financial products is crucial. The Portuguese banking institution behind this data conducted numerous phone-based direct marketing campaigns to promote their term deposit products. Understanding customer behavior and identifying those who are more likely to subscribe can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these campaigns.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their interaction history and demographic information.

Data Overview

The dataset includes information on various attributes such as:

Client Information: Age, job, marital status, education level, etc.
Contact Details: Date of last contact, type of communication, etc.
Campaign Information: Number of contacts performed, days since the last contact, previous outcomes, etc.
Economic Context: Consumer price index, consumer confidence index, etc.
Customer Loan: current loans, previous loans status.
Target Variable (y): Indicates whether the client subscribed to the term deposit (yes/no).
This data is crucial for understanding the patterns and trends in customer behavior that lead to successful term deposit subscriptions.
